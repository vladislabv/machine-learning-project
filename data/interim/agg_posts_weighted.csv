It's incredible that such a tiny sensor from Bosch makes that possible,"" says professional snowboarder and film producer Yanneck Konda. Built into the action camera Yanneck uses for filming, our image stabilization MEMS sensor measures just 2.5 mm x 3.0 mm x 0.83 mm in size and contains parts that are finer than a human hair. Despite its tiny size, the sensor is packed with plenty of power to help the passionate snowboarder capture crisp and stable footage while moving at high speed on uneven ground. On top of that, the sensor runs on exceptionally low power, which helps preserve the camera's battery in extremely low temperatures.

This goes hand in hand with our corporate culture: Diversity, equity, and inclusion are firmly anchored within our DNA.  To take a more active stance for acceptance and increase mutual understanding among employees, a group of Bosch associates founded the LGBT\*IQ network ""b:proud"" back in 2012. Since then, the community has undergone continuous growth and now consists of members from all over the world. Under the motto ""We are as different as everyone else"", the ""b:proud"" network uses an online forum and shared activities to promote communication and to find allies within Bosch. But the network also seeks contact outside the company – thanks to events organized jointly with communities at other organizations. 🤝  With additional initiatives like our internal Diversity Days and workshops, we aim to foster an environment where everyone feels welcome and safe. For us, diversity is reflected in the uniqueness of our associates, their personalities, experiences, and perspectives. ""Invented for life"" is a motto that requires a team effort to live up to — with all the diversity that life has to offer.

Genauso werden Sortieranlagen benötigt. 3️⃣ Entscheidend ist außerdem, dass wir auch solche Kunststoffe wiederverwerten können, die bislang nicht recycelt werden können – etwa weil sie stark verschmutzt sind oder aus unterschiedlichen Lagen bestehen. Dazu braucht es ergänzende neue Technologien wie das chemische Recycling. 4️⃣ Produkte müssen von Anfang an so gestaltet werden, dass sie wiederverwendet, repariert und am Ende ihres Lebens wiederverwertet werden können. 5️⃣ Und last but not least: Kollaboration.

For example, in medical products the hard component is often made of polycarbonate, and it is increasingly common to see soft components made of silicone elastomer. This is because silicones are chemically and biologically inert, as well as notably resistant against extreme temperatures and aging.     To guarantee safe functioning and a more price-efficient production, strong adhesion between the two components is absolutely necessary. Until now, the surface of the polycarbonate had to be primed or activated through plasma treatment.     WACKER is breaking new ground with our new ELASTOSIL® LR 3078 range of products. The liquid silicone rubber adheres strongly to polycarbonates without the need of pretreating the thermoplastic substrate and can also be processed seamlessly with two-component injection molding.

They show a reduced environmental impact like reduced water consumption, lower land usage, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard livestock farming or industrial fishery. Animal welfare and the overuse of antibiotics are other important aspects to consider.  One of the biggest hurdles in commercializing cultivated meat production is the availability and cost of growth medium components. At WACKER, we have made it our mission to improve the availability of key growth medium components for cultivated meat applications and offer cost effective solutions. For this, we want to leverage our well-established technology platforms regarding recombinant protein production in combination with our industrial scale food-grade fermentation capacities.

They show a reduced environmental impact like reduced water consumption, lower land usage, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard livestock farming or industrial fishery. Animal welfare and the overuse of antibiotics are other important aspects to consider.  One of the biggest hurdles in commercializing cultivated meat production is the availability and cost of growth medium components. At WACKER, we have made it our mission to improve the availability of key growth medium components for cultivated meat applications and offer cost effective solutions. For this, we want to leverage our well-established technology platforms regarding recombinant protein production in combination with our industrial scale food-grade fermentation capacities.  In addition, with our cyclodextrin technology platform we have a class of compounds at hand that allows to reduce or even substitute costly or unavailable cell media components.  Meet us at the Annual Meat Evolution Leaders Summit MEVO 2023 in Berlin https://www.meatevo.com/.

Staying healthy is key to being able to work at your peak efficiency. Employees are a company’s greatest asset and a company’s development, and success are directly correlated to the happiness and wellness of its workers.

Medical and Health professionals from Abbott, Adam Vital Hospital and Saudi German Hospital were present along with on-site General Practitioner Doctors to conduct routine check-ups and there were interesting wellness coaching sessions organised with a full delightful talk on Workplace Ergonomics. Not to forget even the Optical Screening organized by Max Vision where the importance of workplace eye care was highlighted.  The initiative was warmly welcomed by all as it inspired individuals to pause and think about their daily habits and take those healthy actions to keep them not only fit but also to enhance consciousness of a positive and healthy work environment.  #WackerMEA #health #healthscreening #Dubai #work #wellness",2023-05-26,3665.0,56.0,3.0,127.0,186.0,0.050750341064120054,0.005011049814449673,8.206583614320753,5.225746673713202

With our new #mRNA competence center in Halle, we are actively involved and committed in this regard; and we are also paving the way to mRNA-based therapeutics of the future, such as novel approaches for treating cancer and cardiovascular diseases.   Our biopharmaceutical activities are part of our Wacker Biotech subsidiary, which serves as a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization \(CDMO\). The fact that we realized the potential of biopharmaceuticals early on, and have been investing in this technology for years, is paying off today, with Wacker Biotech playing a leading role in this field. For example, we hold a pandemic preparedness contract with the German government: if needed, Wacker Biotech and our partner CordenPharma will supply Germany with up to 80 million mRNA-based vaccine doses per year starting in 2024.   Studies predict that the biotech market will grow annually by around 9% percent worldwide in the years ahead. Our Life Science division has set ambitious goals: in 2030, we expect to generate annual sales of around 1 billion euros from this business. Besides our mRNA competence center in Halle, we are currently investing in the construction of a new biotech research facility at our Munich R&D site.  Read more about Wacker Biotech and our important contribution to mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics in our #AnnualReport. Here, you will also get detailed insight into our other solutions for a sustainable tomorrow: silicones for e-mobility; polymers that enable energy-efficient construction; polysilicon that facilitates renewable power generation – and much more.  http://wch.ag/QtiAt  #FY2022 #sustainablefinance  #biotechnology",2023-06-27,8262.0,116.0,8.0,122.0,246.0,0.029774872912127815,0.005011049814449673,9.01942196795671,5.5053315359323625

With modern tiles becoming more and more sophisticated, tile adhesives also have to keep evolving. One characteristic that’s becoming increasingly important in tile adhesives and mortars is good workability: the mortar should be easy to mix, smooth and preferably have a creamy consistency that tilers find easy to work with.   Objective measurement factors for these subjective assessments are viscosity and open time. When developing new VINNAPAS® dispersible polymer powders, we focus increasingly on these properties – for even greater synergy between tiler and tile adhesives.   👉 Find out more about our user-optimized dispersible polymer powders and about our new VINNAPAS® products that enhance the workability and consistency of fresh mortar: http://wch.ag/rbWam  #tileadhesive #construction #vinnapas #polymers ",2023-07-25,373.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,0.01876675603217158,0.005011049814449673,5.921578419643816,1.9459101490553132

Sociale begivenheder på arbejdspladsen giver mulighed for at skabe netværk og relationer blandt medarbejdere. Dette medfører øget motivation og engagement, da medarbejderne bliver mere trygge ved at kommunikere med teammedlemmer og kollegaer fra andre afdelinger, hvilke resulterer i et bedre samarbejde.   Samlet set, medfører det stor kvalitet for den individuelle medarbejder, men også for organisationen som helhed. Se på det som en investering, det gør vi!

The panel argued that while the problems are well known, without a holistic approach across all elements of processing front to back it is challenging to break free of the traditional approaches, and thus break free by utilizing technology across the whole market.

The Future of Work is not just about where we work, but how we work. That is the reason why we want to evolve and share our meeting culture. Our first Monday Meeting Challenge is dedicated to multitasking. By multitasking, we cannibalise our productive time! This Monday’s challenge is to focus 100% on the meetings you join – no chats on Teams or short in-between dialogues with a colleague in parallel. By focusing we enable active engagement by everyone, absorbing information and encouraging solutions.  If you catch yourself multitasking in a meeting, ask yourself why. Is it because your participation is not essential for the meeting? Then ask to be excused from the meeting. Is it because you don’t understand what is required? Then ask the host to clarify. Is it because you’re not prepared enough to follow the conversation? In that case, make sure to take time to prepare ahead of the next meeting. Or is it because you have too many other things to do? Then you might have to re-think your current priorities.  Any other tips?

Obwohl sie sich zuletzt auf 6,1% abgeschwächt hat und die Preise zum Glück nicht mehr so stark steigen wie im Winter, ist es noch zu früh, um Entwarnung zu geben.   Hier einige Fakten: ➡ Von den Kraftstoff- & Heizölpreisen geht mittlerweile ein dämpfender Effekt auf die Gesamtinflationsrate aus. ➡ Die Einführung des Deutschland-Tickets hat zur Abschwächung der Inflationsrate beigetragen. ➡ Bei Gas und Strom hat die Jahresteuerungsrate deutlich nachgelassen. Die Energiepreisinflation liegt gegenüber Vorjahr nur noch bei 2,6% \(Mai-Wert\). ➡ Bei Bereichen, die sich nicht auf Lebensmittel oder Energie beziehen, wie Möbel, Autos, Elektronikgüter, Reisen etc., ist die Jahresteuerungsrate immer noch stark erhöht.  ➡ Bei Nahrungsmitteln liegen die Preise im Schnitt noch immer um 14,9% höher als im Vorjahr.

We’ve presumably all been invited to meetings where we wondered: why me? You might even have a colleague in mind who you think would be in a much better position to talk about this topic or request. In cases like that, we often just forward a meeting invite without informing the host or other participants – and a three-person meeting can fast turn into an eight-person one. This can lead to confusion on all sides. The host is left wondering why more people joined the meeting than expected; the participants are unclear about their roles and if they are really welcome at the meeting.   Today’s Monday Meeting Challenge encourages you to avoid this by planning meetings carefully and thoughtfully. Think about who should be required to join and what their role will be and discuss this with the host.  Our tip for you is to briefly distinguish between roles and inform your colleagues about expectations:  👉 Decision makers: colleagues who need to attend meetings to take a decision 👉 Collaborators: colleagues who need to attend a meeting to facilitate brainstorming or solution approaches  👉 Listeners: colleagues who are asked to listen in to learn or document the meeting outcomes.

Deutsche Bank is determined to play its part – and today, we’re publishing our sustainability strategy for residential real estate. It can cost more than 100,000 Euro to renovate an existing home to meet future EU energy efficiency standards - a major challenge for homeowners. We calculate the cost to our private real estate clients at around € 80 billion.  In our white paper “Residential Real Estate – Leading to Net Zero”, among others, we address the following points:  ✅ We describe how we aim to help homeowners meet this challenge with a unique package of financial support and comprehensive information.  ✅ Our Private Bank’s target is for 12 billion Euro in new business volumes by the end of 2023.  ✅ We also describe how we’re partnering with industry sectors which supply energy, and building materials, to the real estate sector, to reduce carbon emissions across the building life cycle.  For the first time, we are publishing the financed emissions of our € 175 billion EU residential real estate portfolio which accounts for around 40% of our total loan book.

Denn so lange ist das Urlauben noch gar keine Selbstverständlichkeit.  Erst zu Beginn des westdeutschen Wirtschaftswunders der Nachkriegszeit fingen die Leute an, mehr und mehr ins Ausland zu reisen. An Fernreisen war damals noch nicht zu denken, aber Nachbarländer wie Italien, Spanien, Niederlande, Schweiz und Österreich waren bereits begehrte Ziele.  In den 1950er brauchten deutsche Touristen ausländische Währungen oder Reiseschecks. Banken waren die Hauptanlaufstelle für den Wechsel in ausländische Devisen. So warb auch die Rheinisch-Westfälische Bank dafür, unter deren Namen die Deutsche Bank in Westdeutschland damals für einige Jahre firmierte.

118,urn:li:share:7022203733249818624,"How can wind turbines be made even more powerful and reliable? 🤔   After pondering this question, we came up with the solution in the form of our asymmetrical spherical roller bearing. The rotor shaft bearing arrangement is, after all, of central importance, a fact that is particularly true of high-performance installations, in which the locating bearings are exposed to particularly high loads.  The asymmetrical spherical roller bearings developed by us protect against high axial loads while maintaining angular adjustability. The bearings are interchangeable with standard bearings but have a different contact angle.

Accidents involving personal injury are not uncommon in connection with counterfeit roller bearings. Unplanned machine downtime for the same reason can result in high costs for our customers. That is why Schaeffler takes consistent action against plagiarism and has now had more than 30,000 counterfeit bearings destroyed in an action against product piracy. One way of checking whether a bearing is an original or a counterfeit is to scan the product number with Schaeffler's ""OriginCheck"" app.  The code is simply scanned with the smartphone and compared with the unique identification numbers of the Schaeffler products. A traffic light system makes it immediately clear whether it is an original code, a suspicious code or a plagiarism. The app can also be used to send images of suspicious products directly to Schaeffler's Global Brand Protection Team.

A reliable condition monitoring solution can help prevent costly production downtime.

For its numerous standard ancillary units like pumps, fans, electric motors, as well as its core production machines and equipment, Knauf Gips KG chose OPTIME CM, our award-winning condition monitoring solution, in order to have one user interface for monitoring all the different types of machines. This quickly proved to be a good decision. Shortly after being installed, the Schaeffler OPTIME CM system identified problems on two important machines.

You'd be wrong: in the production of beverages and liquid food, even in the recycling itself, one resource is immensely important - water!  For example, did you know that between one and three litres of waste water are generated per litre of beer? Not exploiting such a valuable source of raw materials is out of the question for us at {hashtag|\#|Krones}.  That's why we developed the closed-loop HydroCircle concept. Using customised processes, waste water from production is turned into new process water.  The result: up to 80 per cent less water is needed - an economic and ecological gain for everyone!  Of course, this is only possible thanks to our {hashtag|\#|SolutionsBeyondTomorrow}, including Krones Hydronomic.

And this is exactly what our #Krones UniPure filtration system for wine, sparkling wine and fruit sparkling wine ensures.  And what is particularly important for winemakers to give their product its own, very special taste: Flexibility in production! We work together with the most popular manufacturers of filter elements and housings and configure the ideal filter for you - individually tailored to your needs. Moreover, thanks to two redundantly running filter lines, one line is always available for production while the other is being cleaned or rinsed.  Another special feature of UniPure is that product losses during filter conditioning are avoided thanks to a reworktank. Here, the product is not discarded as usual when conditioning the filters, but can be collected and reused. This minimises product losses and reduces production costs.  UniPure is therefore not just a solution for filtration per se, but a complete solution from a single source.  Are you curious?

Krones has made good progress in implementing its climate strategy, in particular. Here, operational CO2 emissions \(Scope 1 and 2\) are to be reduced by 80 per cent in the period from 2019 to 2030. The group set itself this target in 2020, and since then emissions have gone down each year, a trend that also continued in 2022 when the group succeeded in cutting them by 22 per cent year-on-year, despite record sales of 4.2 billion euros and a correspondingly high production volume.  Krones has set itself an ultra-ambitious climate target, not least for the upstream and downstream supply chains: to reduce Scope-3 emissions by 25 per cent in the period from 2019 to 2030 – irrespective of any increase in sales.  Furthermore, social sustainability shows a positive trend: The share of women in management positions rose by two per cent and that of female employees overall by five per cent.

A big thank you goes out to everyone who was involved in the organisation of the event and of course to all the customers who have joined and contributed!  🙏  During the event, several Krones experts offered sessions on their specialized fields, offering attendees a choice between various topics. One of the highlights of the event was the keynote speech given by an external expert on the Extended Producer Responsibility \(EPR\) law. The EPR law is a new regulation that is being implemented in the Philippines, and it is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of consumer goods. Keeping our customers informed concerning this new law and its effects on the market proved to be a great example of Krones’ partnership goals: “The company is committed to providing our customers with innovative solutions that can help them achieve their goals while also reducing their environmental impact” mentioned Mr. Rodelio Espinosa, Head of Sales Krones Philippines.  What a great way to demonstrate our commitment to shape #SolutionsBeyondTomorrow together with our customers.  Do you have specific questions concerning #Krones solutions or the #EPRlaw that is changing the game for business in the Philippines? 👉 Krones Philippines can help you navigate the changes and ensure compliance.

This is attributable to the company’s improved production processes. On the basis of current production planning for the second half of 2023, the Executive Board has raised the guidance for revenue growth in the full year 2023 to between 11% and 13% \(previously 8% to 11%\).  At the same time, Krones has confirmed the guidance for the other financial targets. This means the company continues to expect an EBITDA margin of 9% to 10% and ROCE of 15% to 17% in 2023.  https://lnkd.in/eZtJiqTC  #Krones #SolutionsBeyondTomorrow",2023-07-17,5250.0,55.0,1.0,52.0,108.0,0.02057142857142857,0.006071947748139469,8.565983355585669,4.68213122712422

Packaging accounts for a good 40 % of this amount.  Although high-quality plastics can actually be recycled quite well in a closed loop, the share of recycled material in production globally is less than 10 %! Now governments are trying to stem the flood with legal regulations, for example: 👉 the ban on certain plastic articles 👉 mandatory quotas for the proportion of recycled material in finished products 👉 binding reuse quotas  But what about us? We have technologies for all these paths! We talk about everything for... ... single-use and returnable PET ... rPET ... recycling plants for various plastics ... plastic-free secondary packaging  As a company that offers beverage producers, among other things, solutions for filling beverages in PET, and at the same time is committed to sustainability, the avoidance, reduction, recycling and recirculation of plastic are key issues.

Anyone who wants to borrow something is deposited as a user, can then reserve the desired item and pick it up very easily with a user QR code.  In the future, this will be done digitally. The great idea and implementation comes from our apprentices in the training workshop: the digital lending station, made out of existing materials!  🗨️ Working on your own projects in the dual study programme, such as the lending station, is good preparation for your later professional life as an engineer. You develop your own ideas about how to realise a project and what approach is needed when problems arise. You also gain initial management experience, such as preparing orders for the production of mechanical components. - Bastian  🗨️ Working in a team is essential when creating such projects. While one person takes care of the construction and wiring, the other two can already work on the development of the programme code and the graphical user interface. This saves a lot of time and problems can be solved more easily. - Jonas  🗨️ Working independently is a skill that is a basic requirement for working on a project like this.

To ensure all germs are effectively eliminated, the procedure for surgical hand disinfection is precisely prescribed. There are the following four steps:   1. 10 minutes before the first hand disinfection procedure on operation day, thoroughly and carefully wash and dry the hands and forearms (if several operations are performed in a day, this step must only be done once).  2. Operate the dispenser lever with your elbow and wet both hands and forearms with sufficient hand disinfectant.  3. Rub hands and forearms and keep them moist for one and a half minutes.

Net als ieder jaar sinds 2009 herinnert de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie \(WHO\) ons ook in 2023 op 5 mei weer aan het belang van handhygiëne in de gezondheidszorg en daarbuiten. Dit wordt gesymboliseerd door de twee handen met vijf vingers. Ook bij HARTMANN besteden we aandacht aan het belang van dit onderwerp op de Wereld Handhygiëne Dag \(WHHD\), met als motto “Handhygiëne is belangrijk voor iedereen”.   Handhygiëne bij professionals in de gezondheidszorg: een respectvol gebaar Goede handhygiëne in de gezondheidszorg – toegepast op de juiste momenten – voorkomt zorggerelateerde infecties en redt jaarlijks miljoenen mensenlevens. Daarom is handhygiëne belangrijk voor alle personen die werken in de zorgverlening. Ook is het een teken van respect voor mensen die zorg nodig hebben, en hiervan afhankelijk zijn. Handdesinfectie is absoluut een van de belangrijkste maatregelen van infectiepreventie. Maar ook handen wassen, huidverzorging en onderzoekshandschoenen zijn onderdeel van handhygiëne. Download hier de poster over dit onderwerp of vraag de poster aan voor in jouw organisatie!   Toon uw betrokkenheid Wilt u actief deelnemen aan het bevorderen van goede handhygiëne, dan kunt u zelf een aantal dingen doen: deel uw kennis, hang onze posters op \(beschikbaar via: https://lnkd.in/eNBYXNzz\), en vier in uw organisatie, in uw privéomgeving en op sociale media de Wereld Handhygiëne Dag \(WHHD\).

In fact, we are currently undergoing a great endeavor to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions to become climate positive in this area starting in 2030.  This includes energy sources such as oil and gas supplied to us by service providers as well as electricity generated by us.  We began sourcing electricity from renew­able sources only three years ago. In terms of Scope 3, which com­prises emissions arising from the procurement of raw materials or from transport, we intend to reach an increased efficiency of 30% by 2025 compared to when we started in 2020.

Das bestehende Green Paper des VDI Round Table wurde in den vergangenen Monaten von vielen relevanten Verbänden kommentiert und jetzt zum finalen Papier konsolidiert.   Auf dem Policy Forum haben Expert*innen des VDI-Round Table CircularEconomy intensiv mit Vertreter*innen von Bundes- und Landesministerien darüber diskutiert, wie eine #Kreislaufwirtschaft für #Kunststoffe ohne fossile Rohstoffe bis 2045 realisiert werden kann.   💡Fazit:   Das Thema hat eine sehr hohe Dynamik in allen Industriebereichen entwickelt. Das zeigt sich in der Kunststofferzeugung der #Chemie, dem breiten Einsatz von Rezyklaten in immer mehr Produkten oder bei den Recyclern mit neuen #Technologien und Geschäftsmodellen.  Gleichzeitig muss dieser Wandel systemisch neu gedacht werden:   ➡️ Lösungen müssen im Dialog aller Beteiligten ganzheitlich gestaltet werden. Dafür bedarf es zunehmend kluger Anreize und Rahmenbedingungen durch die Politik.   ➡️ Es braucht gemeinsam entwickelte Transformationspfade von #Industrie und Politik, um den Weg für alle Kreislaufstufen erfolgreich zu gehen.   ➡️ Ein intelligenter Mix aus Lenkungsinstrumenten kann hier Verlässlichkeit schaffen und als Katalysator für die Transformation wirken.

Die Emission von Treibhausgasen, wie CO2, muss global reduziert werden, damit sich die Erde nicht weiter aufheizt.   Die #Energiewende ist ein wichtiges Werkzeug, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Im Rahmen des Klimaschutzes beziehen wir uns im VDI auf die Sektorkopplung, also die Vernetzung der #Industrie und der #Energiewirtschaft und beleuchten Themen der einzelnen Sektoren, die auf die Energiewende abzielen.   #Klimaanpassung bedeutet, dass wir uns gegen die Folgen des Klimawandels wappnen. Den Klimawandel durch Klimaschutz zu stoppen, wird nicht gelingen, darum ist diese Maßnahme eine dringend notwendige Ergänzung.   Hier müssen unsere Lebensräume für die wachsende Weltbevölkerung erhalten werden und ihre Versorgung gesichert werden.

Die #Industrie hat ihre Infrastrukturen, betriebliche Anlagen und Gebäude sowie Produktions- und Logistikprozesse auf die „übliche“ Verfügbarkeit ausgelegt. Aber im Zuge der Klimaerwärmung verändert sich die regionale sowie saisonale Verfügbarkeit und Verteilung von #Wasser.  Durch die zunehmende Wahrscheinlichkeit von Extremwetterereignissen in Folge des Klimawandels sollten unmittelbare Risiken verstärkt in den Fokus rücken und entsprechend vorgesorgt werden.

Um diese Frage zu beantworten kommen die folgenden physikalischen Fachbegriffe ins Spiel: #Explosion und #Implosion.💡  Bei einer Explosion herrscht in einem Behälter ein hoher #Druck, der sich nach außen entspannt. Im Kontrast herrscht bei einer Implosion in einem Behälter ein niedriger Druck als in der Umgebung.  Mit zunehmenden Druckunterschied ändert sich die Form des Behälters noch nicht zwangsläufig! Der Behälter ist bis zu einem gewissen Belastungsgrad dafür geeignet, den gewohnten Druck auszubalancieren. Aber irgendwann ist die Festigkeitsgrenze erreicht und der Behälter kollabiert schlagartig.  Das geschieht umso schneller, je größer der #Druckunterschied ist.

Ganz aktuell ist es wieder sehr heiß in Deutschland und mancherorts kann das Thermometer bis an oder regional auch über die 35-Grad-Marke klettern.   ℹ️ Von einem heißen Tag spricht man, wenn das Maximum der Lufttemperatur ≥ 30 °C erreicht.  ➡️ Kühlt es auch während der Nachtstunden nicht ab und das Minimum der nächtlichen Lufttemperatur beträgt ≥ 20 °C, spricht man von einer Tropennacht.  ➡️ Folgen mehrere Tage mit ungewöhnlich hoher thermischer Belastung aufeinander, spricht man von einer #Hitzewelle bzw. Hitzeepisode.  Eine Hitzewelle gilt als Extremereignis, das sowohl die menschliche Gesundheit als auch unsere Ökosysteme und Infrastruktur schädigen kann.  Zu den direkten gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen von Hitzeextremen zählen u.a. Sonnenstich, Sonnenbrand, Hitzschlag und Dehydratation.   Vor allem ältere Menschen, Kinder aber auch Personen, die im Freien arbeiten \(z.B. Dachdecker\) sind besonders gefährdet und gelten als vulnerable \(""verwundbare"" oder ""verletzliche""\) Gruppen.  Um hitzebedingte Gesundheitsschäden zu vermeiden und vorzubeugen ist es daher, während derartiger Hitzeepisoden ratsam:  ✅ ausreichend zu trinken,   ✅ die Hitze \(vor allem während der Mittagsstunden\) zu meiden,   ✅ Wohn- und Arbeitsräume möglichst kühl zu halten  \(z.B.

Die Begriffe #NewWork, #Homeoffice, #4TageWoche und #Arbeitszeitverlängerung werden stark diskutiert.    🗣️ Wir haben nachgefragt und unseren Experten Ingo Rauhut, Geschäftsführer Fachbeirat Beruf & #Arbeitsmarkt im VDI e.V., um eine Einschätzung der aktuellen Situation gebeten:   ""Ob eine pauschale Arbeitszeitverlängerung tatsächlich zur Bewältigung des Fachkräftemangels beiträgt, ist fraglich. Arbeiten in der digitalen Transformation verändert sich aktuell fundamental. In der Produktion erleichtern digitale Assistenzsysteme das Arbeiten. Überhaupt verlagern sich Tätigkeiten von der reinen Produktionsarbeit zur Wissensarbeit.   Dementsprechend spielen in der aktuellen Arbeitswelt für Ingenieur\*innen vor allem New-Work-Themen eine Rolle – Wie reagiere ich auf eine zunehmend volatile Welt? Wie können agile Methoden und agiles Denken noch besser genutzt werden, um beispielsweise Rückmeldungen von Kunden frühzeitig einbeziehen? In diesem Sinne verändert sich auch die Art des Arbeitens fundamental und Remote-Work-Formen sind möglich – wenn es sich nicht um die Montage vor Ort handelt – und werden gerade von der neuen Generation Y und Z auch gewünscht und gefordert. Der Wunsch nach Work-Life-Balance muss mit flexiblen Arbeitsformen und hohen Freiheitsgraden in der Aufgabenerfüllung synchronisiert werden – die Forderung nach einer pauschalen Arbeitszeitverlängerung wird nicht auf Akzeptanz in einem von #Fachkräftemangel geprägten Arbeitsmarkt stoßen und einen gegenteiligen Effekt erzeugen.""

Un fenomeno a volte silenzioso, ma che di fatto continua a esistere e anche ad aumentare. Basta guardare i dati per comprendere che la violenza sulle donne, espressa in forma fisica, sessuale ma anche psicologica, rappresenta ancora un problema allarmante. In un’azienda in cui il 55% dei lavoratori sono donne e nel 2021 la percentuale di nuove assunzioni di genere femminile rispetto al totale è stata del 62%, è una priorità l’attenzione e la cultura su questo tema. Ciò che facciamo in E.ON è offrire occasioni di riflessione e confronto sul fenomeno della violenza di genere, promuovere comportamenti virtuosi affinché nel nostro ambiente lavorativo le relazioni professionali siano fondate sul rispetto e l’ascolto indipendentemente dal genere. In questo modo possiamo sviluppare consapevolezza sulle diverse forme di violenza e sui modi in cui questa si manifesta nelle relazioni professionali, affettive e anche virtuali, così come sui fattori culturali che la sostengono, agendo insieme per decostruire stereotipi e pregiudizi. In quest’ottica, abbiamo scelto di sostenere la Fondazione Libellula nata con lo scopo di agire su un piano culturale per prevenire e contrastare la violenza sulle donne e la discriminazione di genere, con una campagna dedicata per dare la giusta rilevanza a questo tema così importante.  #NOIèSenzaLimiti #GiornataInternazionaleControLaViolenzaSulleDonne",2022-11-25,18.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.1111111111111111,0.004632207560436296,2.8903717578961645,0.6931471805599453

The root cause is the large number of old, drafty buildings, expensive to heat and simultaneously producing high #co2  emissions. To combat fuel poverty now in a lasting way, E.ON is working with local authorities to offer a new technology called #DataLake.   This innovation aims to permanently improve energy efficiency in the UK and achieve net-zero levels by 2050. To do this, DataLake pulls multiple data sets from a variety of sources to identify the households most in need, make them visible, and help regional authorities in the application for national funding to fight fuel poverty.   The first successes of the new technology were not long in coming. In the Highland Council, for example, DataLake has already helped to identify numerous households in need and secured funding for necessary measures. But DataLake is having a big impact in more than just rural areas of the UK: The technology has also analyzed the exhaust areas of major UK cities so that properties could be targeted for carbon-saving technologies.   With DataLake, E.ON will now build on its previous work and continue to support local authorities in securing funding and thus tackling fuel poverty.

Per questo abbiamo deciso contribuire al progetto 100 Mattoni che permetterà la formazione di 25 nuovi #giovani che lavoreranno nel nuovo spazio di Monza, trasformando in realtà il sogno di tanti ragazzi.  Siamo felici di supportare un’idea che si fonda su valori importanti e su un obiettivo comune atto a rendere migliore la nostra società.  #NOIèSenzaLimiti #MakeItalyGreen  ",2023-03-23,2569.0,156.0,5.0,25.0,186.0,0.0724017127286882,0.004632207560436296,7.851271997109883,5.225746673713202

Both parties signed a long-term agreement, which involves a large investment by E.ON Power Plants Belgium for the construction and operation of the plant.   The plant has a significant positive environmental 🌍 impact by: ⚡ firstly, generating electricity that avoids conventional power generation with a CO₂ emission of more than 25 000 tons per year \(based on the average emission of power generation in Flanders\), and 🌤 secondly, improving local air emissions by reducing sulfur and nitrogen emissions by an exhaust gas treatment.   In Willebroek, Imerys produces carbon black that is primarily used as key additive for lithium-ion batteries 🔋 serving the important energy transition towards e-mobility 🚗.    Many thanks to our customer, suppliers, project teams and everyone involved! We are now all working hard to ensure that the energy recovery plant goes operational in the second half of 2025 📅.   More information \(press release\): https://lnkd.in/eB7NnfAA",2023-06-21,27864.0,387.0,8.0,460.0,855.0,0.030684754521963824,0.004632207560436296,10.235090812045836,6.75110146893676

In particolare, nella stagione estiva, è importante conoscere il valore e la fragilità della Posidonia oceanica, pianta marina endemica le cui praterie diventano casa, rifugio, luogo di riproduzione e fonte di cibo per molti animali marini.  Insieme a @[UNESCO Ocean](urn:li:organization:11124559), abbiamo dunque condiviso dei consigli utili per conoscere i buoni comportamenti da adottare durante le vacanze estive, al fine di ridurre al minimo il proprio impatto ambientale.

So haben sich bis Mitte vergangenen Jahres erst 46 Prozent der Organisationen im Gesundheitssektor mit dem Thema Klimaneutralität befasst. Bei weiteren 25 Prozent steht es auf der Agenda. Das zeigt unsere Nachhaltigkeitsstudie, die wir gemeinsam mit dem F.A.Z.-Institut für Management-, Markt- und Medieninformationen GmbH durchgeführt haben. Hierfür wurden erstmalig rund 550 Akteure im Gesundheitswesen befragt. Mit dabei waren Praxen, Krankenhäuser, Kliniken, Apotheken, Sanitätshäuser und Vertreter der medizinischen Industrie.  Die Studie gibt Aufschluss, wie die Akteure auf ihre Rolle im Klimawandel blicken, ob sie sich bereits aktiv mit dem Thema beschäftigen und welche Maßnahmen sie umsetzen. Zudem zeigt sie auf, wo rechtliche und organisatorische Herausforderungen liegen.   „Politik und alle Akteure im Gesundheitssektor müssen Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaschutz deutlich höher priorisieren, Hürden in der Gesetzgebung beseitigen und gezielt Anreize schaffen.

Besonders bei Frauen wird die Gefahr eines Herzinfarktes oft unterschätzt, Symptome häufig übersehen oder falsch gedeutet. Bei Anzeichen wie Abgeschlagenheit, Übelkeit, oder Schulter- und Nackenschmerzen denken viele bei weiblichen Personen eher an Stress, Migräne oder eine Magenverstimmung. Auch Ärztinnen und Ärzte erkennen die Symptome für einen Herzinfarkt bei Frauen seltener als bei Männern.    Dabei zeigen wissenschaftliche Studien der letzten Jahre klare Unterschiede zwischen Männern und Frauen – vor allem in Bezug auf Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen. Leider ist dieses wichtige Wissen noch nicht im Bewusstsein aller und der medizinischen Praxis angekommen.    Um mehr Aufmerksamkeit auf das Thema zu lenken, findet heute unter dem Motto #GoRed deutschlandweit der „Tag der Frauenherzgesundheit“ statt. Eine Initiative gesteuert durch die „Herz-Hirn-Allianz“, an der sich verschiedenen Akuteren des Gesundheitswesens beteiligen. Die Aktion verfolgt das Ziel, Veränderungen anstoßen, um die Herz-Kreislauf-Gesundheit von Frauen maßgeblich zu verbessern und auf die Unterschiede zwischen Männer- und Frauenherzen zu richten.

Das kann extrem gefährlich sein, gesundheitliche Schäden verursachen und die Transparenz der Gesundheitswelt erheblich beeinträchtigen. Es wird immer wichtiger, gut beurteilen zu können, welche Informationen wirklich verlässlich und vertrauenswürdig sind.   Als eine der größten Krankenkassen in Deutschland tragen wir Verantwortung – für unsere Versicherten, unsere Mitarbeitenden und ein gesundes Leben in einer digitalisierten Gesellschaft. Deshalb setzen wir uns aktiv dafür ein, Desinformationen vorzubeugen.  Mit unserem BARMER Institut für Gesundheitsforschung (bifg) liefern wir der Politik, Journalistinnen und Journalisten sowie der Gesellschaft qualitative und vertrauenswürdige Gesundheitsinformationen.  Zudem sensibilisieren wir für einen achtsamen Umgang mit Gesundheitsinformationen im Internet und geben konkrete Tipps, wie Fake News im Netz entlarvt werden können. Zu besonders wichtigen Themen, wie beispielsweise Corona, stellen wir allen (nicht nur BARMER-Versicherten) Telefon-Hotlines mit Expertinnen und Experten zur Verfügung. So setzen wir der Flut an (Falsch-)Informationen eine verlässliche Quelle entgegen. Über Instagram-Live-Sessions mit unserer Leitenden Medizinerin Dr. med.

Bei den angehenden Pflegekräften sind es sogar rund 50%. Dabei sind es vor allem die Jüngeren, die einen Berufswechsel in Betracht ziehen. Viele sind emotional erschöpft und haben starken Schlafmangel. Diese Ergebnisse zeigt unsere neue Pflegestudie, die wir gemeinsam mit dem IFBG – Institut für Betriebliche Gesundheitsberatung durchgeführt haben.   Im Firmenkundenbereich beraten wir als BARMER über 5.500 Unternehmen zu unterschiedlichsten Arbeitgeber- und Gesundheitsthemen. Hier zählen auch Krankenhäuser, stationäre Pflegeheime und ambulante Pflegedienste zu unseren Partnern. „Wir haben den Anspruch, Firmen auf dem Weg zu einem gesunden Arbeitsplatz zu begleiten. Damit wir unsere Partner gerade im Bereich der Pflege noch besser beraten und unterstützen können, führen wir regelmäßig Studien durch, um unsere Beratungsangebote entsprechend weiterzuentwickeln und stetig zu verbessern. Besonders die Pflegestudie war uns ein Anliegen, weil insbesondere Pflegekräfte durch die Corona-Pandemie extremen Belastungen ausgesetzt waren. Hier möchten wir mit Maßnahmen der betrieblichen Gesundheitsförderung unterstützen“, erzählt Philip Ende aus unserem Firmenkundenbereich.

Trotzdem besitzen nicht einmal die Hälfte der Bürgerinnen und Bürger in Deutschland die digitalen Basiskompetenzen. Bei den Schülerinnen und Schüler sind es sogar lediglich 48%.   Trotz des allgemeinen Fortschritts beim Wissen und den Kompetenzen zur Digitalisierung in der Bevölkerung wird es eine wichtige Zukunftsaufgabe sein, die Resilienz und digitalen Kompetenzen weiter auszubauen. Das zeigt die aktuelle Studie Digital-Index 2022/23 der Initiative D21 e. V., die jedes Jahr ein umfassendes Lagebild zur Digitalisierung in Deutschland liefert.  Das haben wir bei der BARMER auch erkannt und engagieren uns im Rahmen der D21 Initiative aktiv, um eine verantwortungsvolle Digitalisierung im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Dr. Frederike Escher (siehe Bild) ist Vorständin bei der Initiative D21 e. V. und leitet bei der BARMER die Abteilung „Extraleistungen – Kundenzentrierte Services und Produkte“. Mit ihrer Expertise Human-Centered-Design entwickelt sie Digitalprodukte basierend auf menschenzentrierten Bedürfnissen.

Auch wir wollen den Monat nutzen, um für das Thema zu sensibilisieren und auf die Darmkrebsfrüherkennung aufmerksam zu machen. In Deutschland erkranken jedes Jahr aufs Neue über 64.000 Menschen an Darmkrebs. Dabei beginnt die Krebserkrankung schleichend und unbemerkt, bis es dann im späteren Verlauf zu Beschwerden wie sichtbar blutigem Stuhlgang, starken Bauchschmerzen und Verdauungsbeschwerden kommen kann. Wird Darmkrebs jedoch frühzeitig erkannt, stehen die Chancen auf eine gute Behandlung und Heilung recht gut.    Für unsere Versicherten bieten wir die digitale Darmkrebsfrüherkennung bereits als erfolgreichen Teil unseres Versichertenservice an. Der Vorteil: Digitale Darmkrebsfrüherkennung gibt es bereits ab 40 Jahren. Fast 42% der Versicherten, die das Angebot bisher in Anspruch genommen haben, waren unter 50 Jahren. Rund 1.400 (4,4%) der Proben in dieser Altersgruppe waren positiv. Dieses Ergebnis unterstreicht die Bedeutsamkeit unseres Angebots, das von der Stiftung Lebensblicke mit dem diesjährigen Präventionspreis ausgezeichnet wurde.  Im Darmkrebsmonat März bieten wir dieses Angebot im Rahmen unseres internen betrieblichen Gesundheitsangebots auch für alle Mitarbeitenden ab 40 an. In unserer internen Mitarbeiter-App „BARMER4me“ geben unsere Betriebsärzte Dr. med. Martin Goth und Martin Stumm (rechts im Bild) per Video wichtige Hinweise zur Darmkrebsvorsorge und rufen unsere Mitarbeitenden zur regen Teilnahme auf.

Unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen erwartet in den kommenden Wochen ein bunter Mix aus Maßnahmen zur Bewegungsförderung im Alltag. Dabei wird das Thema Bewegung unter verschiedenen Perspektiven beleuchtet: Bewegung im Homeoffice, Sport und Psyche, körperliche Aktivität und Ernährung, Bewegung und Abnehmen, Sport und Entspannung und Bewegung und Nachhaltigkeit. Dabei legen wir besonderen Wert darauf, Theorie und Praxis miteinander zu verknüpfen. Neben theoretischen Impulsen werden hybride Kurzaktivierungen und Trainingseinheiten angeboten, die problemlos in den Arbeitstag integriert werden können.    Ein weiterer zentraler Praxisbaustein wird unsere beliebte Schritte-Challenge sein, die im 50-tägigen Aktionszeitraum stattfindet. Verschiedene Wettbewerbe wie eine Gesamt-Challenge, ein Unternehmens-Battle mit unserem Partnerunternehmen Christ Juweliere und Uhrmacher und eine Geo-Challenge sorgen für Spaß und Abwechslung. Dabei kommt es uns nicht auf sportliche Höchstleistungen an, sondern den Spaß an Bewegung zu fördern, praktische Alltagstipps zu vermitteln und zu (mehr) körperlicher Aktivität einzuladen.      Unser Bereichsleiter Personal Robby Herzog (siehe Bild) lädt alle Mitarbeitenden ganz persönlich per Videobotschaft zur Aktionsstrecke und der Schritte-Challenge ein: „Lassen Sie uns diese Aktionsstrecke gemeinsam als Chance nutzen, uns öfter zu bewegen und uns gemeinsam fit zu halten.“   Wir freuen uns auf eine erfolgreiche und gesunde Bewegungserfahrung zusammen.

Dort hatten Seniorinnen und Senioren die Möglichkeit, all ihre Fragen zu unserer elektronischen Patientenakte \(kurz #ePA\) loszuwerden. Wie kann ich meine Dokumente in der App hinterlegen? Wie werden Berechtigungen erteilt? Wie sicher ist die elektronische Patientenakte wirklich?  Um diese Fragen nicht nur theoretisch zu besprechen, hat Bérengère die Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer per Screensharing durch die BARMER eCare App geführt und ist jeden Schritt praktisch durchgegangen.  „Solche Veranstaltungen bestätigen mir immer wieder, dass das Interesse groß ist und sich die Aufklärungsarbeit lohnt“, berichtet Bérengère nach der Veranstaltung. Wir bei der BARMER setzen uns für eine verantwortungsvolle Digitalisierung im Gesundheitswesen ein. Dieses Ziel können wir nur erreichen, wenn wir alle mitnehmen und sie dabei unterstützen, ihre digitalen Kompetenzen und ihr Wissen auszubauen.

Mit der Kampagne setzen wir uns für eine geschlechtersensible Medizin ein! Denn im medizinischen Kontext ist die Gleichbehandlung von Frauen und Männern gefährlich und kann sogar lebensbedrohlich sein. Frauen erkranken anders als Männer - und umgekehrt.

Gerade bei Gesundheitsthemen kann dies äußerst gefährlich sein. Mit zunehmender Digitalisierung wird es immer wichtiger, gut beurteilen zu können, welche Informationen wirklich vertrauenswürdig sind.

Wir hatten das Fokusthema „Bewerbungsprozess und Onboarding“ mit im Gepäck. Wie schätze ich mein Einstiegsgehalt am besten ein? Darf ich im Bewerbungsgespräch das Thema Gehalt überhaupt ansprechen? Ist ein Bewerbungsanschreiben heutzutage noch ein Muss? Darf ich im Lebenslauf mit meinen Fähigkeiten pokern? Das waren Themen, die die Studies interessiert haben.  Nachdem alle Fragen geklärt waren, haben wir uns anschließen im „FuckUp-Format gegenseitig von unseren Missgeschicken im Bewerbungsprozess erzählt, um gemeinsam aus unseren Fehlern zu lernen und auch gemeinsam darüber zu lachen.

Unser Ziel ist es, sie bereits während ihrer Ausbildung für das Thema Gesundheitsförderung zu sensibilisieren und ihnen die Möglichkeit zu geben, diese in ihrem Ausbildungsbetrieb aktiv mitzugestalten. Gleichzeitig möchten wir die Kreativität der jungen Talente nutzen, um innovative Gesundheitsideen zu entwickeln – von Mitarbeitenden für Mitarbeitende. In diesem Jahr sind bundesweit 150 Azubis und 24 Ausbildungsbetriebe mit an Bord. Wir freuen uns sehr über das große Interesse an dem Thema ❤️.   Letzte Woche haben @[Svenja Folkerts](urn:li:person:KPioHITN6f), Fachreferentin Betrieblichen Gesundheitsmanagement \(siehe 1. Bild\) und @[Ingo Barth](urn:li:person:m4_RF2pBKP), Projekt Spezialist das Kick-Off Event mit allen Teilnehmenden veranstaltet. Dabei wurden sie in den diesjährige Move Guide und das damit verbundene Projektmanagement eingeführt.   Bis Ende Oktober haben die Azubis unserer Firmenkunden nun Zeit, kreative Gesundheitsideen und Konzepte für ihre Kolleginnen und Kollegen zu entwickeln und anschließend passende Gesundheitsideen im Ausbildungsbetrieb durchzuführen. In diesem Jahr steht gesunde und nachhaltige Ernährung im Arbeitskontext als Fokusthema auf dem Plan. Wie können sich Berufstätige auch im Arbeitsalltag und stressigen Zeiten gesund und nachhaltig ernähren? Bei dieser Fragestellung sind den Azubis keine Grenzen gesetzt.   Im November werden dann die drei Gewinnerteams mit den besten Gesundheitsprojekten gekürt. Wir sind gespannt auf viele kreative und innovative Ideen und wünschen allen teilnehmenden Azubis für die kommenden Monate ganz viel Spaß mit dem Thema.   #MoveGuide #GesundesArbeiten #Gesundheit #externesBGM ",2023-06-05,4201.0,65.0,0.0,1734.0,1799.0,0.4282313734825042,0.02496245185346226,8.343077871169383,7.4949862339505335

Wir möchten einen Ort der Begegnung und des Austausches schaffen, an dem wir gemeinsam Impulse, Gedanken und Erfahrungswerte teilen können. Wie möchten wir unsere Arbeitswelt in Zukunft gestalten? Wie können wir aktiv Kultur gestalten? Wie stellen wir gesundes Arbeiten am Campus sicher?  In interessanten Vorträgen, Walk-Ins, Info-Stationen und Kulturformaten hatten unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen letzte Woche die Chance, sich ein Bild von unserem Campus der Zukunft zu machen und auch, sich aktiv einzubringen, mitzugestalten und zu den Themen in den Austausch zu kommen. Als Arbeitgeber freuen wir uns besonders über den Walk-In „Vereinbarkeit von Leben und Beruf“, an dem wir rund um das Thema Vereinbarkeit ins Gespräch gekommen sind. Beispielsweise zu unserem Arbeitsmodell „Führen in Teilzeit“ und neusten Initiativen wie dem Väternetzwerk. Zudem haben wir uns mit den Ideen und Wünschen unserer Kolleginnen und Kollegen auseinandergesetzt, um die Vereinbarkeit künftig noch besser auf die individuellen Bedürfnisse unserer Mitarbeitenden auszurichten.

In sieben wöchentlich wechselnden Schwerpunktthemen und der 50-tägigen Schritte-Challenge haben sich unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen „Fit für den Sommer“ gemacht. Und das mit vollem Erfolg: Ob eine Joggingrunde zum Start in den Tag, ein Spaziergang mit den Kollegen in der Mittagspause oder die Wanderung am Wochenende – während des Aktionszeitraums haben unsere Mitarbeitenden beeindruckende 435 Millionen Schritte und 283.000 Kilometer zurückgelegt. Das entspricht umgerechnet fast 10 Weltumrunden. Wow - Was für ein Ergebnis! 🤩   Unsere Kollegin @[Katja Hofbauer](urn:li:person:973qK_wHBO) aus dem externen Betrieblichen Gesundheitsmanagement hat an der Challenge teilgenommen und ihre Erfahrungen mit uns geteilt: „Schon als unsere diesjährige BARMER Schritte-Challenge angekündigt wurde, habe ich mich wahnsinnig darauf gefreut aktiv daran teilzunehmen. Aufgrund meines berufsbegleitenden Studiums sitze ich mittlerweile gefühlt den ganzen Tag an meinem Schreibtisch. Mein Ziel war es, meine tägliche Bewegung als klassischer „Schreibtischtäter“ auf 15.000 Schritte pro Tag zu steigern. Anstatt meine Mittagspause passiv zu verbringen, nutze ich sie nun aktiv und mache einen kurzen Spaziergang. Es ist erstaunlich, wie sehr sich meine Energie und meine Stimmung dadurch verbessert haben - Mittagstief adé. Aber nicht nur das – ich habe auch eine kreative Lösung für die vielen internen Meetings gefunden. Anstatt stundenlang im Sitzen zu verbringen, nutze ich wenn möglich mein Walking Pad und bleibe so in Bewegung. Es hilft mir, fokussiert zu bleiben und meine Gedanken klarer zu strukturieren. Es war schön zu sehen, wie mich die Challenge dazu motiviert, mein Bewegungsziel auch über mehrere Wochen zu verfolgen. Ich kann es nur jedem empfehlen, die Challenge selbst auszuprobieren!“  Doch nicht nur die Schritte-Challenge kam gut an. Besonders beliebt waren auch die 5-Minuten-Aktivierungen mit unseren Gesundheitsbotschafterinnen @[Heike Drechsler](urn:li:person:muf-5CQwt8) und @[Christina Obergfoell](urn:li:person:xe5zhtqIfP). „Die 5-Minuten-Aktivierungen waren super und haben richtig Spaß gemacht. Gerade im Homeoffice wird schnell mal die Bewegung vergessen, da ist ein solches Angebot sehr hilfreich. Ich würde mir wünschen, dass solche Angebote auch nach der Aktionsstrecke dauerhaft bestehen bleiben“, erzählt unsere Kollegin Brigitte Burkhardt.  Wir sind total glücklich und stolz über die positive Resonanz und die großartige Leistung unsere Mitarbeitenden. Ihr habt die letzten Wochen super genutzt, um einerseits eure eigene Gesundheit zu fördern und euch gleichzeitig gemeinsam als Team zu motivieren oder untereinander zu challengen.

Mit dabei: Unsere beiden Kollegen Farai Mafuruse und @[Julian Stegemann](urn:li:person:pal3GqzBDU) \(siehe Bild 1\), die sich als Volunteers vor Ort ehrenamtlich engagieren.    ""Ich mache das zum ersten Mal und bin total neugierig"", erzählt Farai Mafuruse bevor er sich auf den Weg nach Berlin macht. Farai unterstützt die Athletinnen und Athleten in dieser Woche direkt vor Ort auf dem Tennisplatz. In seiner Freizeit spielt er selbst leidenschaftlich Tennis und freut sich daher umso mehr, diese Woche im Tennisbereich unterstützen zu können. ""Inklusion ist ein wichtiges Thema. Leider geht es im Sportbereich total unter und findet vor allem in den Medien und bei Veranstaltungen viel zu wenig Beachtung. Letztes Jahr hat mein Tennisverein gegen eine Tennismannschaft gespielt, in der alle Spielerinnen und Spieler im Rollstuhl saßen. Das Spiel war der Wahnsinn. Es war total beeindruckend zu sehen, was diese Sportlerinnen und Sportler mit ihrem Handicap leisten können. Das sollte viel mehr Anerkennung finden. Für mich sind die Special Olympics eine tolle Möglichkeit, mich in diesem Bereich zu engagieren und stark zu machen!""    Julian Stegemann steht in dieser Woche am Merchandising-Stand im Olympiapark und macht auf die Veranstaltung aufmerksam. Er hat während seines Masterstudiums ein Praktikum bei den Special Olympics absolviert und war bereits letztes Jahr bei den Nationalen Spielen dabei. Im Bereich Marketing und Kommunikation bereitet er Texte und Merchandising für die Spiele vor und wirbt vor Ort für die Veranstaltung. „Es hat mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht, auf die Veranstaltung aufmerksam zu machen und dafür Texte und Produkte zu entwickeln. Viele Menschen in Deutschland kennen die Special Olympics noch gar nicht. Das möchte ich gerne ändern"", sagt Julian. Deshalb ist er auch in diesem Jahr wieder mit dabei und macht am Merchandise-Stand ordentlich Werbung für die Veranstaltung.   Es ist sehr schön zu sehen, wie sich die beiden in diesem Bereich einsetzen.

Gemeinsam mit zahlreichen Kolleginnen und Kollegen haben wir eine digitale Urlaubslandschaft geschaffen, die unseren Mitarbeitenden auf spielerische Weise das Wissen rund um die digitalen Tools der täglichen Arbeit, die digitalen Services der BARMER und Fachbegriffe rund um die Digitalisierung vermittelt. Bei der Entwicklung war es uns besonders wichtig, dass sich die Lernplattform in den Arbeitsalltag unserer Mitarbeitenden integrieren lässt. So stellen wir sicher, dass unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen bestens für die Zukunft gerüstet sind. Denn Digitalisierung kann nur gelingen, wenn wir unsere Mitarbeitenden in die Prozesse einbinden und sie bei der Entwicklung von Lösungen mitwirken lassen.    Unser Präventionsprogramm DURCHBLICKT! wurde in der Kategorie ""CDR und Verbraucherbelange"" mit einem CDR-Award in Bronze ausgezeichnet. Das Programm richtet sich speziell an Schülerinnen und Schüler, Lehrkräfte und Eltern und unterstützt sie dabei, ihre digitale Gesundheitskompetenz zu stärken. Denn im Internet werden sie täglich mit einer Vielzahl von Informationen und Fake News zu Gesundheitsthemen konfrontiert. Um digitale Gesundheitsinformationen zu finden, zu verstehen, richtig einzuordnen und auf die eigene Gesundheit anzuwenden, braucht es eine fundierte Gesundheitskompetenz notwendig.    Die beiden Auszeichnungen machen uns ganz besonders stolz, denn der CDR-Award wird an Unternehmen verliehen, die die Digitalisierung besonders verantwortungsvoll gestalten.
